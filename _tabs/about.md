## Hi there 👋

- 👨‍💻 I work as a [software engineer, software consultant and quality engineer](https://www.cqse.eu/de/company/team/marcel-bruckner/) at [CQSE GmbH](https://cqse.eu){:target="\_blank"}.
- 👨‍🎓 I successfully finished my master's degree in [Informatics: Games Engineering](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/informatics-games-engineering-master-of-science-msc){:target="\_blank"} with my [master's thesis](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Brucknem/CDN/main/master-thesis.pdf) that I have written at the [Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Real-time Systems](https://www.in.tum.de/en/i06/home/){:target="\_blank"}.
- 🍸On the weekends, you might find me at [Blitz Club](https://www.blitz.club/), either working or partying.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Computer Vision, Continual Learning and Reinforcement Learning.
- 💬 Ask me about anything. I'm happy to discuss any topic and even more if I can help you.
- 📫 How to reach me: The email related to this account if visible. Otherwise create an issue on any of my projects and I will respond to you.
- ⚡ Fun fact: There are a lot of nice organisations like [4Ocean](https://www.4ocean.com/){:target="\_blank"} or [German Zero](https://www.germanzero.de){:target="\_blank"} that fight against worldwide pollution and climate change. They are always happy to get support.
